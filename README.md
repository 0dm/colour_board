# colour_board
an eye dropper for your clipboard

colour_board displays the colour for the pixel in the middle of your screenshot, designed to be used with window's snipping tool but it should work on all platforms.

colour_board_debug is an alternative version that will save the image in clipboard to a "temp folder" used to debug.

# Defaults
- F2 -> Input clipboard
- F12 -> Force Quit

# Requirements:
- `pip install pillow`
- `pip install pynput`
